## whoami

Hi, I am Jai Luthra. Welcome to my little corner of the internet. My interests revolve around tech, music and philosophy.

I currently work as a Linux Kernel Engineer at [Ideas on Board](https://ideasonboard.com), working on device drivers for the camera subsystem.
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering from [IIIT-Delhi](http://iiitd.ac.in) in 2019.
You may take a look at my <a href="/files/cv.pdf">CV</a> for more details.

My technical interests are image processing, data compression, reverse engineering (mostly x64), and hardware accelerated computing.
In other words, I love tinkering with systems of all shapes and sizes.

Rest of my productive time is spent writing [blog posts](/blog), [poetry](/poetry) and attempting to cover the [music](/music) I love (:
