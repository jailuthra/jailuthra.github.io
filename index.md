## whoami

Hi, I am Jai Luthra. Welcome to my little corner of the internet. My interests revolve around tech, music and philosophy.

I work as a Software Development Engineer at [Amazon Fulfilment Technologies](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/aft).
I recently completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering from [IIIT-Delhi](http://iiitd.ac.in).
You may take a look at my <a href="/files/cv.pdf">CV</a>.

My technical interests are multimedia transcoding (ffmpeg, VLC), reverse engineering (mostly x64), control systems and hardware acclerated computing/graphics.
In other words, I love tinkering with systems of all shapes and sizes.

Rest of my productive time is spent writing [blog posts](/blog), [poetry](/poetry) and attempting to cover the [music](/music) I love (:
