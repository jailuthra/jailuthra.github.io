## longing ##

decaying memories, hazy dreams  
racing heart, restless nights  
flowers primed to blossom again   
reborn after dark and light  
  
chilly nights were familiar terrain  
now warm sunlight seethes again   
on shy buds that timidly unfurl  
into a cosy comfortable curl  
  
but the summer is fleeting  
impermanent warmth  
the cycle of demise  
goes on and on  
  
petals once so bright and vivid  
now dull and pale, fall to the earth  
clumsily embraced by withering winds   
are longing and yearning for rebirth   

## the beast ##

the depth screams, unnerving shrieks  
beneath the blue waves of sorrow   
I pay no heed, o shadowey beast  
knock my door again tomorrow   
  
tumbling, straying, disarranged   
my vessel sails off the chart  
I've had my stumble, o great sea serpent   
the hull gives in, can no longer last   
  
my ship roars, the beast growls   
pervasive water, consuming all  
imprisoned by what I thought was mine   
drowning deep, endless fall  
  
smash, crash, my head collides   
hell, ive arrived at my destiny   
collapsing deck, devil is nigh   
swim out the wreck, you're free   
  
seeing the light, I scream and shout   
hearing back the silent hiss   
from the surface, a shadow is seen   
rising, soaring, fiend of abyss   
  
the dark orb, swelling out  
light and shadow, intertwined   
a gasp for air, at last i am here   
man and beast, undisguised   

## the pilgrimage ##

breaking all promises he made   
to himself and to the lord above   
he sifts through the dim lit graves   
arrives at the shrine of his love   
  
whips out his shovel   
digs through the dirt  
oh how he missed her smile   
he never intended to hurt  
  
he lifts his queen up above   
lays her gently on the damp mud   
the sky calmly weeps o'er them   
sanctifying, a gentle flood   
  
the flies have laid their eggs   
larvae swim through his blood   
flesh and filth clinging on him   
burning ulcers in his gut   
  
surely he must pay for his deeds   
maybe in this life? maybe the next hundred?   
for now, his sins are washed away  
by the blessed showers of red   


## in for more ##

in the darkest hour   
breeze standstill   
dance of the shadows   
forbidding chill   
  
he rambles on   
the beaten path   
in search of light   
in search of stars   
  
but the clouds of doom   
o'er his head they loom   
move they seldom  
that wretched gloom  
  
muffled cries of pain   
closer every step   
a frail leper he sees  
slouching ahead   
  
he approaches, unbidden  
nails clawing on his core  
head arose, it shouts  
thou art in for more  

## floating ##

i want to keep floating   
this calm ocean, my old friend   
the sun burning dry  
my skin cracked and red   
  
violent waves are coming  
to lift me up, pull me under   
the turbulence is not taxing   
my heart is the storm's center   
  
the winds may howl   
the clouds may burst   
even the greatest downpour  
won't quench my thirst   
  
i will just keep on floating   
floating in this sea of dread   
the sun smouldering me dry   
my skin cracked and red   

## epilogue ##

the rebellion ends here  
you and me lying bare  
insecurity is my prey  
i'll hunt i'll chase you away  
  
the craving and compulsion   
(this tug of war has no end)  
the dependence and addiction  
(this tug of war needs to end)   
  
from us and them   
(you were never really wanted)  
to you and me   
(you were never really needed)  
uproot the succubus   
(your cronies all absconded)  
i soar above your insincerity  
  
let the blade sink deep inside   
tonight it's time for you to die   
paranoia's personification  
(rip it, stab it, bleed it away)  
goodbye.  

## bots of a tether ##

voltage spike  
overdrive  
my fluctuating circuitry  
you stabilize,  
this floozy hack   
bypassing the absurdity  
  
denying  
defying  
we're bots of a tether  
floating till the   
doom ahead  
lost in this misty aether  
  
pivoting  
spiralling  
high and low, off and on  
terminate,   
with kernel panic   
nuclear phenomenon  
  
sparks extinguish   
but not the core   
no, it's always humming on   
beep on   
beep on   
beep on, you crazy automaton  

## maggot queen ##

engulf me, consume me  
your rotten core, eyes of napalm  
laid your eggs in this sea  
now drown in the tranquil calm  

slyly slithering in my veins  
it feels like feathers and thorns  
creep away to deeper hollows  
flee away from rising storms  

you are the maggot queen  
i am the enormous dead  
i've mastered the art of pouring  
my soul into a broken keg  

decompose. Disintegrate.  
chew, chew away on this decay  
you squirmy little piece of shit  
no redemption for you today
