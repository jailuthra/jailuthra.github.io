title: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - Precise Pangolin Review
---
Ubuntu 12.04 will be released in some weeks. People are excited about a new Long-Term-Support Release of Ubuntu Linux.
This release is going to be really wonderful with these new features -

<b>Unity 5.8</b>
It will have Unity 5.8 as the default desktop. This is the only thing I don't personally like about Ubuntu.


<b>Linux Kernel 3.2</b>
The Kernel will be upgraded from 3.0 to 3.2. In addition, the AMD64 server version has been consolidated into the generic one to minimize the maintenance burden over the life of this Long Term Support (LTS) release. Several other kernel improvements have been made as well, including support for additional ALPS touchpads.

<b>Rhythm Box </b>
Rhythm Box will be the default Music Player, leaving Banshee downloadable.

<b>New Configuration OptionsÂ  </b>
Unity will be more easy to configure.
<b>
Ubuntu One Control Panel</b>
It will be a little different from the previous one.

<strong>HUD</strong>
The new Heads-Up-Display is a very useful feature of Unity 5
All menus can be searched by slapping Alt and typing in the HUD.
Firefox's bookmark search is also included!
Softwares like Gimp, Audacity get more productive because of HUD.
