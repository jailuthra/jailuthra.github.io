A shitty analogy of the current CAA debate is the _mankad_ in cricket. It's not against the rules, but
against the spirit of the game.

[Mankading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out#Vinoo_Mankad), named after Vinoo Mankad for doing
it a couple of times, is the dismissal of an unsuspecting out-of-crease batsman by the bowler during
his run up. It is considered rude, and not very sportsman-like because it is a cheap way to get
someone out. Non-strikers often go out-of-crease while the ball is being delivered, to get an edge
at running towards the other end. Almost every batsman does that.

It is also considered rude because the bowler goes out of his way to dismiss the batsman, breaking
his run-up. A bowler is supposed to bowl once he starts his run and can get warned if he does not
deliver the ball for whatever reason.

Mankading might be an ethically gray thing to do, however you cannot remove the rule to knock a
batsman out if he's out-of-crease. That is the only deterrent for the batsman to not go
out-of-crease. If you remove the rule, what stops him from going all the way out to the striker end
before the ball is even bowled?

And anyway, a rule is a rule. Desperate times call for desperate measures to get a wicket for the
team. And the batsman is usually warned for being out-of-crease by the bowler or the umpire before a
mankading takes place.

[Citizenship Amendment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act) is a topic of
controversy right now because it uses religion as a criteria to decide which fleeing immigrant from
neighbouring countries can become a Citizen of India. The Indian Constitution grants every citizen
some [fundamental rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights_in_India), which includes
the  _Right to freedom of religion_. But it says nothing about which outsider gets to become a
Citizen.

A common argument is made that CAA is against the _spirit of the law_, similar to mankading. That it
is a cheap critieria to decide who gets in. Even though it is perfectly legal to have a religious
criteria, much like it is perfectly legal to Mankad, even if rude.

A counter argument to it is that not having any criteria, allowing anybody claiming persecution the
right to become a citizen, would be foolish.

But like a bowler is meant to bowl, a government is meant to govern, to ensure national integrity
and development. Why go out of the way to introduce a controversial act?

On the contrary, desperate times call for a desperate measure -- and it is not breaking any rules.
Certainly there are better ways to design asylum for persecuted immigrants, like there are better
ways to get a wicket. But we've got what we've got.

And one cannot dismiss that the other 'team' has not gone out-of-line despite warnings. This Act is
a symbolic deterrent in a sense. Ah, the analogy has gotten hairy thin now, nonetheless the
point still holds.

One can hotly debate about both these issues for hours and conclude nothing. But the stakes are very
high in real life. No matter which side has the ethical higher ground, it would definitely be in the
spirit of sport to have a civil debate -- and very rude to demonize, or worse, kill each other (: 

<small>__Disclaimer:__ CAA paired with [NRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens)
in its current form is a different ballgame though. The loosely defined criteria for proving
identity may lead to existing citizens stripped off their rights, while giving the executive-wing too
much leeway. But for the sake of discussion I've stuck to only CAA in this post.</small>
