Patches sent on the [ffmpeg-devel](https://ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel) mailing list for review:

* [\[PATCH 1/2\] lavc/lpc: Add min\_shift parameter in LPC](http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2016-August/198099.html)
* [\[PATCH 2/2\] mlpenc: Working MLP/TrueHD encoder](http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2016-August/198100.html)

List of commits during GSoC period:
<https://github.com/jailuthra/FFmpeg/commits/mlpencoder?author=jailuthra>

### Tasks completed:

* Working MLP and TrueHD encoder
* MLP supports multiple channel layouts
* TrueHD has experimental support for multiple channel layouts (Not guaranteed to work on hardware, but is decodable by ffmpeg)

### Tasks currently working on:

* Provide stereo downmix substream in TrueHD so that it is guaranteed that it plays on all hardware
* Fix some issues with lossless checks that arise with LFE channels and s32 (24-bit) audio. Once this is fixed we can enable 24-bit support in the encoder.
* (Optional) Write the bistream verifier, similar to those present in proprietary encoders for MLP and TrueHD.
