Here is a close-up photo of a flower taken using an iPhone 13:

The smudginess in the out-of-focus areas—especially the stem and the base of
the flower—is very jarring to look at.

Recently, whenever I've tried to take an image with even a modest digital zoom
of 1.5x-2x—whether it's of a bird, natural scenery, or a concert where I'm some
distance from the stage—I see a similar heavily post-processed, smudged-out
mess of pixels. And this isn’t just Apple; it’s true across similar mid-range
Android phones as well (I’ve tried Google and OnePlus).

For contrast, here is a similar photo taken using a relatively cheap digicam
(Kodak PixPro FZ45) that is still available to buy in the market:

The realness/rawness of this image is very apparent (to me, at least) compared
to the mess you see in the first image.

The market for digicams has been very quiet for the last 5–10 years, except for
a few models like this Kodak that are targeted towards Gen-Z TikTok trends
glorifying 2000s “retro” aesthetics (I am admittedly Gen-Z too). And this is by
no means a good digital camera. I remember using much better ones a decade ago
that cost a similar amount.

I was never into photography as a hobby. I take a bare minimum number of
pictures while travelling, just to serve as a checkpoint that “hey, I was here
once.” Sadly, given the absolute garbage that a mid-range (~₹30k–50k)
smartphone captures today, I'm considering carrying a dedicated digicam for my
next trip.

Congrats, we've come full circle. There are no small-sized (4–5 inch) phones
available that have the bare minimum features needed to navigate the world in
2025—things like a 4G/5G connection and a basic smartphone OS to support apps
for maps, UPI/banking, cab hailing, and countless other tasks that make a
smartphone mandatory (like a constantly changing QR code for a concert ticket).

Anything that should last you more than a year is a big ~6-7 inch slab that
barely fits in your pocket and costs north of ₹30k. And it can’t even take a
decent picture. So you must carry a second device for that, just like in the
old days.

Anyway, apologies for the rant. I’ll go back to my day job… which, ironically,
involves writing Linux drivers for cameras.
