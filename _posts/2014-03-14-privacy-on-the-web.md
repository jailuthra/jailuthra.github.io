The state of privacy on the Internet is spine-tingling scary. I will not repeat the effort of
blabbing about [how you are being tracked](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying) on almost every corner
of the web. I would rather prefer to tell the tale of how I am trying to save my arse.

[Prism-Break](http://prism-break.org) was extremely helpful, in providing me alternatives.

I deleted my facebook account (which had >500 friends), and created a new one with around 30
friends, whom I actually need to talk to. Some weeks ago, I deactivated this account too.
I have (almost) stopped using Google for searching the Web, and use [DuckDuckGo](http://ddg.gg)
instead. For personal emails I now use [Riseup](http://riseup.net), and GPG encryption.
I use FirefoxOS on my smartphone, and download only those apps from the Marketplace which
have their code open for public review. I switched to [Diaspora](http://diasporafoundation.org/)
- an alternative social network. But maybe I lack the courage to delete my Google+ account.

I was using *StatCounter* for this blog to keep a track of visitors and *Disqus* for 
comments. Until I fired up [Lightbeam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbeam_%28software%29)
and saw how almost every website I visit uses Google Analytics. I personally find it wrong
that if someone visits my blog, their information (ip address, user agent) is not just
transmitted to my website, but also to third-party services which further share it with their
'Partners' and advertisers.

But don't you worry. I have now got StatCounter, Disqus and GoogleFonts API disabled on this website.
Better late than *never*!
