title: Google Code-In Prize
---
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/2012/">Google Code-In</a> was an awesome experience, got to learn more about Open-Source development, and how I could contribute to different organisations. All the mentors were very friendly, and helpful, and worked me out through the tasks.</p>
<p>And finally this morning, the t-shirt and the certificate for participation in GCI got shipped.<br />
</p><p>I really hope, that next year I complete more tasks (much much more), and get a chance to visit Google Headquarters, Mountain View, CA. :)</p>
