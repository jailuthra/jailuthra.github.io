<a href="http://www.peppermintos.com/"><b>Peppermint</b></a> is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Ubuntu (actually a Lubuntu fork). It is a lightweight operating system, containing minimal applications installed by default.

<ul>
	<li>It uses Openbox, the design is pretty simple for new users, that have used Windows or other Linux Distros.</li>
	<li>Most of the applications in Peppermint are Web based, like Gmail, Google Calendar etc.</li>
	<li>Any web-page can be made to behave like a native application using <b>ICE</b>, go to Menu-&gt;Internet-&gt;Ice.</li>
	<li>Full control in your hands, It would work even on a old, slow computer, but it just needs some awesome software, that can be downloaded from its Software Center, to make it a supercomputer!</li>
	<li>On netbooks, most Operating Systems get slow after a while.
Peppermint is heaven for netbooks.
You can do almost anything on the Internet; listening to music, watching videos, creating and editing docs and even keep files and you can make it an app in your menu.
You just need to fire up Ice, and make an application (for example Grooveshark.com/Facebook.com), and it will be right there in your main menu waiting for you.</li>
	<li><b>Google's Chromebook</b> certainly loses the match with a Peppermint netbook, as Peppermint does everything as efficiently as chromebook on your netbook (maybe Peppermint isn't as beautiful on the first sight), but if you want it to do more you always have an option!</li>
