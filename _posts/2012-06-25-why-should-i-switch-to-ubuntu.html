title: Why should you switch to Ubuntu?
---
Many people think that -
<ul>
	<li><i>Linux is a command-line.</i></li>
	<li><i>Linux is for programmers.</i></li>
	<li><i>Linux is only used on servers</i>.</li>
</ul>
You are wrong if you thought so!


<b><i>"<a href="http://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> is a free and open-source GNU/Linux Operating System."</i></b>Explaining this statement will make you understand <i>Why Should You Switch To Ubuntu?</i> -

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>OPERATING SYSTEM</b></span>
<ul>
	<li>An Operating System is like Windows, or Android, iOS, Mac OSX etc.</li>
	<li>Most special of them are GNU/Linux distros , Ubuntu is one of them.</li>
	<li>Many of you will think that why should you learn using a whole new operating system. But you have to do that even in your current OS (assuming it is Windows).
With Windows 8 coming soon, you will have to learn a whole new thing, so it is better to learn something good rather than wasting your time and money on crap.</li>
	<li>There is a learning curve, but most of the users find it easier to learn the simple Ubuntu's Unity interface rather than some tiled, made for tabs, UI.</li>
	<li>Ubuntu 12.04 is packed with amazing features, I have written a <a href="http://blog.jailuthra.in/2012/04/ubuntu-1204-lts-precise-pangolin-review.html" target="_blank">review</a> on it.</li>
	<li>It also has a great app <i>Gwibber</i>, which keeps you updated (via Notifications) with your Social Networks like Facebook, Twitter etc.</li>
	<li><i><a href="http://one.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu One</a> </i>is a very great app for sync services (like Dropbox), it is integrated in the ubuntu panel.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>GNU/LINUX</b></span>
<ul>
	<li>Linux is a kernel i.e. it is the is the bridge between applications and the actual data processing done at the hardware level. Linux is not an operating system without applications.</li>
	<li>A Linux distro like Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint; truly makes an OS with the help of the Linux Kernel and applications.</li>
	<li>With so many distros to choose from you can always find a distro which suits you.
<i>"Your OS should suit you and not vice-versa. </i>" - Someone Like Me</li>
	<li>In Ubuntu (and other Linux distros) you cannot run the usual .exe files which you may be using earlier (if you used windows), for installing software in Ubuntu you need to have its .deb package or its source-code.</li>
	<li>.deb files can be installed very easily using a package manager like <i>Ubuntu Software Center</i> or Synaptic.</li>
	<li>If you are desperate to run .exe files in Linux you can use Wine for GUI applications and DosBox for DOS apps. ( I recommend you to leave your previous .exe world completely)</li>
	<li>You DO NOT need an anti-virus for Ubuntu as Linux itself is Virus-free (atleast for now, maybe some years ahead you have to).</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>OPEN SOURCE (FREE AS IN FREEDOM)</b></span>
<ul>
	<li>Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.</li>
	<li>It is open source, which means that you can modify it or improve it's source code, which is freely available to every user.</li>
	<li>Most of the software which come preinstalled in Ubuntu are also open source, like Firefox, Libre Office etc.</li>
	<li>There is also freedom to choose between so many Desktop Environments and Default Applications.</li>
	<li>Those who prefer using Google Chrome can download Chromium (Chrome's open source brother) from Ubuntu Software Center. Or you can download Google Chrome itself from the web.</li>
	<li>If you are used to the desktop interface that Windows offers, you can use <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE" target="_blank">KDE</a> which feels much more similar to Windows.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>FREE AS IN BEER</b></span>
<ul>
	<li>Here<i> free</i> refers to cost-free. You DO NOT have to pay a single dime for using, upgrading or downloading free software on Ubuntu.</li>
	<li>Ubuntu is and always be, free of cost.</li>
	<li>It saves you so much money (or helps you from committing the crime of piracy) because you don't need to spend (waste money) on buying an OS for your computer.</li>
	<li>Most of the software that you need to use daily are available forÂ  free in <i>Ubuntu Software Center</i>.</li>
	<li>There are many great games available for free that can run on Ubuntu. Example: Xonotic.</li>
	<li>You have a free alternative for almost every software you use.
Replace MS Office with Libre Office (which comes out-of-the-box with Ubuntu) or with Google Docs. Libre Office will run all your .doc(x) and .ppt(x) files without any hassle.
Adobe Photoshop users can use GIMP for image editing.</li>
