title: Now running Arch Linux

<p>It's been very few days that I (again) installed <strong><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a></strong> on my Desktop, which also serves as the host of this blog.
The last time I installed Arch was months ago through a virtualbox, I had some troubles in installing Xorg and left it there and then. Arch requires too much time to install and I liked the easy-to-use Ubuntu setup I then had.</p>

<p>Some months back, I switched to Fedora. Fedora releases latest software in their update channel much quicker than Ubuntu i.e. It is somewhat a cutting-edge distribution. I started liking the <i>cutting-edge</i> ideal.
Thus, I tried <b>Arch Linux</b> again.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arch is a <b><i>BLEEDING-EDGE</i></b> Linux distribution. KDE 4.10 was added in its testing repo within hours of release. And there are no Arch releases (like 11.10, 12.04 etc) rather it has a rolling-release model , you just need to <code>pacman -Syu</code> to update your system making it just like the newest download link available on their download page (actually even newer) ;)</li>
	<li>It has a wonderful package manager known as <tt>pacman</tt>, which downloads and installs simple binary packages from Arch repos, so no need is left for <tt>.deb</tt> or <tt>.rpm</tt> and other shit.</li>
	<li>The installation is fairly long, you need to do everything from setting localtime to generating <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> from the commandline. But after a single successful install you would <b>learn so much</b> that your Linux knowledge can even go from a Noob to a Wizard. :D</li>
	<li>Installling it might seem some wicked sorcery without this <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide" target="_blank">wonderful guide</a> in ArchWiki.</li>
	<li>Do not be surprised when after installation is complete you are left with just a bash shell. Install video drivers, Xorg, and a DE (I use KDE) to get a familar environment.</li>
	<li>I would never recommend Arch to most users, because I feel that Arch is best suited for those Linux users who -
<ol type="i">
	<li>Have some time to devote (for installation and maintenance). It is bleeding-edge so some rare updates might even break your system.</li>
	<li>Are geeks using Linux for a while now, and want to go a little more deeper into it.</li>
	<li>Are intersed in compiling some software (like Dropbox) that just provides RPMs and DEBs (they're more popular). And for them Arch Community have <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">AUR</a> which has almost every needed package's tarball avialable that can be compiled very easily using <tt>makepkg</tt> utility, which will also fetch the dependencies, and make a tar.xz package which is installable by <tt>pacman</tt></li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If you just want a bleeding-edge distro but are not interested in long installations then you might try <a href="http://chakra-linux.org/" target="_blank"><b>Chakra Linux</b></a> which is a KDE-based fork of Arch, and doesn't require you to be an expert to use it.</li>
	<li>I would suggest that you go through their <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">wiki</a>, and read <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way" target="_blank"><i>The Arch Way</i></a> once which describes the principles and philosophy of Arch Linux.</li>
</ul>
