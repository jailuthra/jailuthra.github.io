Do numbers exist? I can count three mangoes, or four pebbles. They’re right
there, I can pick them up, I can touch them with my hands. But where is this
number called 3 or 4?

Well, you might say that the mangoes may rot and the pebbles may get lost, but
there is something eternal, a unique value behind the multiple mangoes, called
the number 3\. Similarly the number 4 is the representation of the four-ness of
pebbles. If the pebbles themselves are lost, the four-ness persists, across
other things that are found together in groups of 4\. So yes, numbers exist.

You might also convince me by saying that these numbers help us keep count and
settle transactions. You may lend 3 x 100 rupee notes to someone, and they
might give you 6 x 50 rupee notes back, and you understand that even though
they’re giving back different physical items, they’re returning to you the same
abstract value of 300\.

But do you see, the first time somebody proposed the idea of 0, or of negative
numbers, some people may have reacted in the same way as I did for natural
numbers. “Have you ever seen \-3 cows?”. “Why do you say there are 0 cows when
there is nothing, why even talk about cows? Are you mad?”. “Negative numbers
are not found anywhere in nature”. And so on.

And similar reasoning can help us understand their existence and utility.
Negative numbers balance our accounts. We can count one direction (of taking
money) as positive, and the other direction (of giving money) as negative, and
balance them up to find how much total money we have left. The physical reality
exists indifferent from the existence of these numbers. They’re just abstract
concepts that help us, the physically real beings, in manipulating and managing
our physically real things. We could do things the harder way too. You could
maintain two different accounts for giving and taking instead of introducing
the negative sign and using a single account. You could even not have names and
sounds corresponding to numbers, and point to actual physical 3 cows. But doing
that is so much harder, isn’t it?

Similarly, the first time somebody said that we could use √-1, it seemed crazy.
You can’t multiply two numbers to get a negative number, so where does this √-1
come from? Why talk about it or use it? Well these imaginary numbers help us
immensely with vector multiplication. Representation and calculations in signal
processing and quantum mechanics would be unnecessarily complicated if we stick
to real numbers, as real numbers are one dimensional, on a number-line. But
complex numbers can naturally represent 2 dimensions if you see i \= √-1 as
perpendicular to the number line. Thus any multiplication of \-1 on the number
line can be seen as one 180° rotation, which can be broken down into two 90°
rotations with i. And we could use combinations of real and imaginary numbers
for rotating any arbitrary amount of degrees, representing it in very tidy
exponential notation. So instead of relying on complicated 2D vector
representation using real numbers, we could use a single complex number, and
the multiplicative math all checks out much cleaner.

So, do these imaginary numbers really exist? Or are these just tools that help
us? Ask your neighbouring physicist or engineer if they would like to give them
up. If we loosen up or stretch the rules in this abstract space of mathematics,
we stumble upon concepts that are quite handy. Who are we to claim one of these
concepts is less real than the other, when ultimately they all help us navigate
the real world?

Now, moving beyond just numbers, we know that summing together an infinite
number of numbers in a series can sometimes converge on a single point, like 1
\+ ½ \+ ¼ … \= 2\. But for other series like 1 \- 1 \+ 1 \- 1 \+ 1 … the sum
doesn’t converge. It fluctuates between 1 and 0 depending on where you stop.
So, it may be a stretch, but we can say the sum is “=” ½ in some sense of “=”
equality, which is looser than the one we used for convergent series. Using
just this one loosening, we can
[derive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww) that 1 \+ 2 \+ 3 \+ 4 ..
“=” \-1/12. A divergent series, which surely approaches infinity under
conventional addition, can be said to be equal to \-1/12 in some sense of the
word “equal”.

“This is a cheap trick” one might say. It is surely nonsense and not “real”.
But well it does make sense to loosen the definition of equality, as long as we
maintain some constraints, see 3B1B’s [chapter on analytic
continuation](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/zeta) for more. And
ultimately, it makes it easier for us to understand real, physical phenomena
(more on that later, I promise).

Modern mathematics is mostly playing around with these abstract ideas that have
no real utility, until they do. There are many examples where math has preceded
real physical discoveries. For example, non-Euclidean geometry might seem like
nonsense at first glance, as it can have weird behaviours like sum of angles in
a triangle not summing to 180°. “Surely you can’t draw or find me a triangle
like that in the real world” you might say. But these non-Euclidian geometries
are what preceded Einstein’s theory of relativity with space-time curving due
to mass. The theory that explained measurements that Newton’s idea of a
gravitational force couldn’t. It even predicted black holes and gravitational
waves, which are real physical phenomena that were confirmed by experiments
much later.

Similarly, Paul Dirac sought a relativistic wave equation for the electron. The
equation he came up with [produced solutions for both positive and negative
energy states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-W-w8yNiKU), which was
problematic, as how can something have negative energy? Instead of rejecting
the math, he proposed that it could be possible that there may exist particles
with opposite charge but same mass as electrons (positrons). Nobody had ever
seen any such anti-particle before, but lo and behold, \~4 years later Carl
Anderson discovered it accidentally during his experiments with cosmic rays.

Let’s take a small detour, and talk about nothing for a moment. I promise this
is related to the divergent series before. So what exists inside nothing? Let
me be more precise and ask, what exists in a vacuum in deep space? Far, far
away from any galaxy, where there is no trace of thermal energy (0 Kelvin). One
would assume it is nothing. One would also assume it is static. In fact, such a
physical location is the best way to solidify the abstract concepts of “static”
and “nothing”.

But let’s think deeper for a moment. Based on the science we already know from
high school we say a magnet can attract other metallic objects from a distance,
and it happens without a medium. Same for the forces between electrical
charges. If we have two charges in empty space at absolute zero, there is
nothing between them, and yet they are pushed together or pulled apart.
Similarly, we say that light travels as an electro-magnetic wave in nothing.
There was a big search for a material medium or “ether” for light, like we have
water or air for waves and sound, but ultimately all observations pointed to
the fact that light is indeed waving in nothing.

Well, it may be physically empty, but we do represent the underlying medium as
a [Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_\(physics\)), which is a
mathematical abstraction. The idea is that every point in space, denoted by
some coordinate system, has some value (be it scalar, vector or tensor). With
this idea, we no longer have to deal with each particle influencing each other
particle, and can simply use the underlying Field for book-keeping the total
aggregate forces acting at any point in space. Even if this “Field” is not a
physical medium made up of matter, it is as real as the numbers we use to
measure the physical forces.

But does this field really exist in deep space, with no charged particles,
where the value at every point is surely 0? Well yes, just like I can point to
my empty stable and say I have x horses, where x \= 0\. A trickier question to
answer intuitively is whether the values of this field remain static in absence
of any charged particles. And also, are particles born out of this field, or is
the field just a made-up abstraction to represent the behaviour of real
particles. The answer to these depends on whom you ask, or how you look at it.
A great example is the [**Casimir
Effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect) proposed in 1948, as
explained below.

If you take two neutrally charged sheets of metal, in empty space, at 0 Kelvin,
and place them very very close (microns apart), they are attracted to each
other. This is counter-intuitive if you ask me, as I would have thought in
absence of any external force or thermal energy, matter should just be wherever
it is. Static and unmoving. But reality says no, and we can even calculate the
exact force of attraction using two ways:

The first, and easier way (in my humble opinion) is to look at it
macroscopically, which involves an assumption that there are fluctuations in
the EM field even in a perfect vacuum, known as the [Vacuum
Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy). This implies that
reality, even when empty of everything, is not static but vibrating. It is
vibrating with all possible frequencies. So when we bring two sheets of
conductive metal really close together, we constrain the EM waves present in
the space between these two sheets. These are 3 dimensional standing waves, but
they can be understood analogous to the 1 dimensional standing waves that
happen when a guitar string vibrates.

In the guitar’s case, the string is constrained at two points. The main pitch
of what we hear comes from the vibration of the whole string. But what we hear
is not just a single wavelength, which if you listen using a sine-wave
generator sounds very bare. Instead, the physical string is free to move every
which way between those two points, so we get smaller and smaller waves layered
on top of the main one. These higher pitched vibrations happen at integer
ratios of the string, also known as
[harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic) (so the wavelength is 1/2,
1/3, 1/4 … and so on) and gives the guitar its fuller sound.

Similarly, in empty space we have all possible frequencies of EM waves, but
constrained by two sheets we have only the limited harmonics in the region
enclosed by them. This creates a force that pushes the sheets closer together.
If we try to calculate this difference, even with a toy 1D model, at one point
we have to sum up the energy of all the harmonic standing waves. Energy is
proportional to frequency, so we add up integer multiples of the base frequency
(so 1x, 2x, 3x …), which is a divergent sum. There is a boundless infinity of
waves pushing the sheets from the outside, and a constrained infinity pushing
them from inside. But we know there are no infinite energies in physical
reality, so we know that these two infinities should “cancel out” to give us a
finite, inward pushing force on these sheets. And if we just plug in 1 \+ 2 \+
3 \+ 4 … \= \-1/12 as we derived before, the math “works out”, giving us
negative energy in the interior region, pulling them closer. Sorry for the lack
of rigour in my explanation, but I hope you got a rough idea.

Experimental validation for this effect was done much later (in 1997\) to
measure the exact force, and it gave the same value as predicted by these
calculations, within a few percent of error. So, does this mean that 1 \+ 2 \+
3 … is equal to \-1/12 in a real sense? And that empty space is really
vibrating with all possible frequencies?

Well, there is a second way to understand and calculate this force, by looking
at it microscopically. The metal has so many molecules, all influenced by
London Dispersion forces which act even at 0 Kelvin. These forces mean that
electrons are never static, so various atoms in one sheet can sometimes
instantaneously align, leading to a momentary polarization, which induces the
same polarization across space on the other sheet of the metal. The two sheets
then act like very weak magnets, enough to attract each other. This gives us
the same numerical values with a different theoretical understanding. But even
in this case we have to make some unintuitive assumptions, like electrons not
being static at 0 thermal energy.

Both of these theories are weird, but ultimately these are just mathematical
models of our underlying physical reality. The sheets are attracted to each
other with some force irrespective of the abstractions we use to understand it.
Reality is weird, so our abstractions have to match the weirdness. The
microscopic abstraction at the electron level leads to clunkier calculations,
while the macroscopic abstraction at the EM field level requires us to
renormalize divergent sums, and using the \-1/12 result. Both of these require
us to believe in vibrations even at absolute zero. Temperature or heat is
understood as a macroscopic measurement of kinetic energy of microscopic
particles. But here we either have to believe that the electrons can never be
made completely still, or see it as fluctuations in the underlying electric
field. Beyond the edge of my current understanding are more modern theories
like [Quantum
Electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics) that
unify electromagnetism, special relativity and quantum mechanics under a single
Field.

Let’s come back to Dirac’s equations predicting the existence of
anti-particles. Did the positron pop into existence because of his search for a
beautiful equation that combines Einstein’s relativity and Schrödinger’s wave
functions? Of course not. The positron was always there, just like gravity was
bending light, and light was shining, way before we came up with the
mathematical models for them. This abstract plane of mathematics cannot
directly affect our material plane. But I want to make a bold claim here, that
the mathematical plane is also “real” in a sense, in the same exact sense of
the word “real” as various other planes that philosophers and poets have sung
about since millenia.

Many people, when first asked to explain what mathematics or physics is, give
an explanation that is something like a “Map of reality”, where ultimately the
[Map is Not The
Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation). For
example, the place called New Delhi is where I am living, but pointing it on a
map of India is not that same place. The location on the Map is a location on a
piece of paper. It is just a concept or abstraction of the real territory of
New Delhi, but it helps us understand and navigate real territory.

But there is something missing in this idea. A map maker has to survey the
territory before creating the map. In a sense, he is bound by his experiences
of the territory. On the other hand, Math is tangibly more powerful. It can
shine light upon unknown territories, and even shepherd us beyond the horizon
like it did with Dirac. It is not a mere map of reality that we have already
explored, but another plane of reality, with its own rules and structure, its
own independent reality. Exploring this plane, searching for a beautiful
equation, Dirac peeked outside the boundaries of what we knew about the
territory of our physical reality. From the point of view of a human who has
not developed the “faculties” to interact with this mathematical plane
directly, a slab of glass that helps you talk to your friend face-to-face from
across the planet is not so different from magic.

In various ancient eastern philosophies we hear about the existence of other
planes or [Lokas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loka) of reality. Schools like
[Vajrayana Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana) and [Trika
Shaivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Shaivism) are explicit in
stating that the other Lokas are not at a separate physical location, as is
often imagined by people who point at the sky. Instead, they are metaphorical
pointers, or abstractions of complicated mechanisms, and connected to the
physical reality or Bhu Loka through our thoughts and actions.

Like the plane of mathematics cannot directly cause things on our material
plane, the abstract deities of light ([Devas and
Devis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_\(Hinduism\))) from these other Lokas
can’t hurl stones at us. Our physical reality is still shaped through the
physical actions of physical beings. For example, through people who are
exploring these realms, trying to connect with these deities, be it through
Mantra meditation, or esoteric rituals, or drawing abstract connections between
different sounds, symbols, images and forces of nature. These beings of
abstract realms are similar to how [Mathematical
Platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Platonism) posits that
numerical entities like Pi are eternal, waiting for humans to tap into their
mysteries by exploring the abstract, structured landscape of mathematics. How
every imperfect circle found in nature is the entry point to explore the
perfect circle on this other plane of platonic ideals.

Traditions that practice [Tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra)
emphasize the reality of these other realms or planes. These esoteric and
secretive traditions understand deities to be eternally present, who can reveal
themselves to humans as Mantras (sounds), their corresponding Yantras
(patterns), or visual human and animal like forms, holding different objects,
performing various Mudras (hand-poses). Just like numbers are more than just a
tool, so are these sounds and symbols. They’re eternally present in these other
planes for us to access, understand and help us discover new territories on
this physical plane.

Some practices involve chanting a particular deity’s mantra, while
concentrating on their corresponding yantra, visualizing the deity in their
anthropomorphic form, or placing different sounds corresponding to these
deities at different parts of your own body. This is believed to transform the
practitioner’s reality from the ground up, metaphorically speaking. That is,
transforming the subtlest aspects of their consciousness, the ingrained mental
patterns and so on, until this transformation boils up, and fructifies, in the
physical reality of their neurons and cells.

The plane of these deities is structured with psychic and symbolical patterns,
it is understood using myths and archetypes, and explored using ritual and
devotion. Analogous to the plane of Mathematics and Physics that is structured
with formal patterns and understood using logic and reasoning. To an outsider,
this might seem like magical thinking, but that is similar to how a time
traveller from the 16th century will see magic and sorcery in inventions like
GPS, made possible only through highly abstract Math and Physics.

A great example to tie this all together is Ramanujan, the famous mathematician
from the early 20th century, who pushed the boundaries for summation of
divergent series, and had the idea that 1 \+ 2 \+ 3 \+ … while divergent and
unbounded, could also be seen as equal to \-1/12 in some sense. He was well
regarded by his peers, like GH Hardy, for his exceptional intuition. He filled
many notebooks with formulas and results, often arriving at them directly,
while the rigorous proofs for the results were derived by him or others later
on.

Whenever he was asked how he arrived at the results without step-by-step
reasoning, or whenever he was awarded or credited for his exceptional work, he
would attribute all of it to Devi Namagiri and her consort Narasimha, who he
said [communicated with him through
dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan#Personality_and_spiritual_life).
Rather than dismissing it as mere humility, I feel we should respect his
wishes, and credit Devi Namagiri for his work. Because Ramanujan’s Devi is at
least as real as the mathematics that was enlightened by her, through him.

In many eastern traditions, physical reality is understood as being pervaded by
subtler planes of existence. Planes of logic and reasoning, of symbols, of
potential, going subtler and subtler till you reach the pure Self (Atman), the
Vast (Brahman) or Emptiness (Shunyata). The etymology and boundaries of these
planes might depend upon the tradition, but the overall structure is very
similar.

Ramanujan got his insights through what we can understand as the subtle plane
where his Devi resides. He even mentions seeing flowing blood (linking it to
Narasimha), and other [symbolic references in his
dreams](https://kristinposehn.substack.com/p/ramanujan-dreams). He had this
unique ability to receive insights in a language compatible with symbols of
both the planes of Devas and formal Math. And of course, he was well trained in
logical reasoning, to establish and solidify some of these insights as formal
proofs (while also leaving many unproven in his [Lost
Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%27s_lost_notebook)).

In the present day we have even managed to connect some of his ideas to
phenomena in our physical reality. We saw one example above. To claim that just
the mathematical structure is real but the spiritual structures are not, is in
my opinion a grave mistake. Same as claiming natural numbers are real while
imaginary numbers are nonsense.

You might object that the idea of planes might make philosophical sense, but
practically speaking Science and Math have given us tangible results. The
modern scientific era and the industrial revolution have given the world
undeniable material progress. While symbolic thinking and dogmatic beliefs had
led to countless wars, famines and diseases before.

But maybe we should take our heads out of the narrow hole of recent Western
European history, and look at other civilizations in the world, across wider
timespans. So many  parallels exist between the language, beliefs and practices
of Europe, Iran and India if we go back far enough. There has been a continuous
exchange of ideas across the  globe, right from the time of Bronze Age
civilizations, if not before. So I urge you to pick a system that navigates
these subtler realities, one that is well established, has a mostly unbroken
lineage of teachers and teachings, and start exploring this other plane of
symbols and rituals for yourself. Practice it, same as we practice Mathematics
or Science.

For example, you could pick Vajrayana Buddhism, spend a few years understanding
their philosophical lens to view reality, but more importantly doing the
prescribed practice(s). If it gives you tangible results and experiences,
invest more time and energy. If not, move on to some other system. One can
stick to the Scientific Method and use their own subjective experience as
evidence, discarding what seems like dogma in these traditions. But as a first
step, one has to drop the dogma that outright dismisses ideas subtler than
physical reality.

A word of caution here \- the result of these practices is naturally going to
be what the tradition claims as its goal. Some traditions aim towards material
success and stop there, some aim towards enlightenment or freedom from
suffering, through the renunciation of material world. While others are all
encompassing, claiming material success, fulfillment of worldly desire, inner
peace are all valid stepping stones towards ultimate freedom. So spend some
time exploring the landscape before choosing your destination and charting your
path.

You may dismiss [Tai Chi](https://jailuthra.in/2025/11/provable-existence.html)
as just glorified breath work and stretching exercises, but there are so many
results published since 2020 that show that Tai Chi is significantly better at
treating hypertension, anxiety and depression, better at increasing lean mass,
when done in controlled trials against “non-mindful” forms of simple stretching
or breathing. So why do we dismiss the reality of Qi or Prana, which are
analogous to the Math behind the Engineering of Tai Chi or Yoga? You might not
find physical correlates of Qi or Prana or Chakras if you dissect a body, but
belief in these ideas, exploring them in their own plane of existence, has led
to practices that give tangibly better results than what 20th century
understanding of physiology could. Thus, I claim that Prana or Chakras are as
real as Calculus or Number Theory. Just like Mathematics, these are not mere
conceptual maps of our physical reality, but more powerful, as they too can
lead our understanding beyond the horizons.

The decision is ultimately up to the individual. An engineer can either use
complex numbers and make his life easy, or stay a purist and go about the same
calculation the hard way. Similarly, I can either explore these subtler planes,
or dismiss anything that is not physically real or immediately intuitive.

Let’s come back, once again, to the concept of the vibration of “nothingness”
we were discussing before in the context of Casimir’s experiment. You can
debate that Fields are not a real thing but just empty space, and what is
*really* real is matter. Or you can view the Field as the emptiness that is the
essence of reality, where all sub-atomic particles of matter are just energy
values of this field, quantized in particle-like chunks, existing in an
abstract complex plane as a cloud of probability, entangling with each other to
produce this tangible-ness. As Alan Watts puts it, it is a cosmic dance, with
no nouns, only verbs. In my humble opinion, both of these ways of looking at
things are equally “real”.

In Trika Shaivism reality is conceived as the non-dual Shiva, the underlying
conscious void beneath reality. This void is static, but it is also dynamic. It
is vibrating with Shakti (translated as energy or power). This vibration of
nothingness is known as Spanda. If I blur my eyes just enough, I can see how
this view of reality eerily rhymes with the fluctuations of EM fields in empty
space.

Reality is vast and incomprehensible. It can be seen using different lenses,
that is, through different abstract structures. Just as the force in Casimir
Effect could be calculated with different models, one where we posit that
nothing likes to vibrate, and in another we see the same nothingness as a
static container, for matter that is never at rest. I am not saying that
because reality is weird, we should accept any weird theory. Quite the
opposite. We should accept only self-consistent theories that explain the weird
phenomena of our reality.

Some traditions like Nyaya and Advaita Vedanta stuck to logic, and extensively
debated scholars from other schools. While other traditions may focus on
looser, symbolic reasoning, with greater emphasis on ritualistic practice or
devotion. But ultimately the reality is vast, and human brains are limited, so
there are necessarily going to be multiple self-consistent view points (like
[blind men describing an
elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant)).

This idea goes back quite far. Here’s a verse from Isha Upanishad (Yajur Veda
Ch. 40 Verse 5), which was originally orally transmitted, with strict
intonation and meter to avoid corruption, and is at least 2500+ years old:

<center>
तदेजति तन्नैजति तद्दूरे तद्वन्तिके ।<br />
तदन्तरस्य सर्वस्य तदु सर्वस्यास्य बाह्यतः ॥ ५ ॥<br />
</center>

That moves (*tad ejati*) and That moves not (*tan naijati*), That is far (*tad
dūre*) and the same is near (*tadvantike*). That is within all this (*tad
antarasya sarvasya*) and That also is outside all this (*tadu sarvasyāsya
bāhyataḥ*). 

The verse may seem contradictory, but later philosophers like Shankara (c. 800
CE) wrote detailed [commentaries on cryptic verses from Vedantic
texts](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/ishavasya-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc143813.html)
to establish well-structured theories like Advaita (Non-duality). If you are
intrigued by the parallels these ideas from ancient spiritual traditions have
with descriptions of reality of modern physics, you are not alone, and this is
not a mere coincidence. Many of the scientists that established the foundation
of modern physics, like Bohr, Schrödinger, Oppenheimer and Einstein were avid
readers of Vedantic texts like the Upanishads (where the above verse is from)
and the Bhagavad Gita. It was Bohr in fact, who suggested the idea of
zero-point energy to Hendrik Casimir of the Casimir effect.

Similar to how Tai Chi is born from the understanding of Qi, we should pay
attention to the philosophies of Vedanta, Trika or Buddhism that rhyme so well
across different planes of reality. Many of these traditions see reality as a
fluid, interdependent non-duality. They rhyme well with our best understanding
of our material universe, even if they approach it through the opposite end, by
flipping around a core dogma of modern thinking right on its head. The dogma
that objective reality of matter is real, but subjective reality of
first-person experience is just an epi-phenomena – something to be explained
away – as mere excitations in neurons.

These traditions instead claim that the subjective first-person awareness, that
is indisputably real to every living being, is the ever-present dynamic static
at the base of ***all*** reality. This subject is not separate from the
multiplicity of shapes, forms and experiences of objects observed and illumined
by it. A practitioner of these traditions is empowered to experience this
Non-Duality in their own first-person awareness, by simply listening, logically
reasoning, and meditating upon these teachings. Because really, [You are
That](https://jailuthra.in/2025/11/provable-existence.html).
