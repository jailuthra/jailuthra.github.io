The following is an excerpt from [Guru Granth Sahib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Granth_Sahib) Ang. [152-153 (Raag Dakhni Gauri)](https://gurugranthdarpan.net/hindi2/0152.html):

---

पउणै पाणी अगनी का मेलु
{:.verse}

Air, water and fire come together.

चंचल चपल बुधि का खेलु
{:.verse}

A play of restless child-like intellect.

नउ दरवाजे दसवा दुआरु
{:.verse}

Nine doors (of the body) and the tenth gate (through which the Light shines).

बुझु रे गिआनी एहु बीचारु
{:.verse}

*O wise one, reflect on this thought.*

---

कथता बकता सुनता सोई
{:.verse}

The speaker and the listener are all the same One.

देही माटी बोलै पउणु
{:.verse}

Body is clay that (walks and) talks.

बुझु रे गिआनी मूआ है कउणु
{:.verse}

*O wise one, understand what really dies.*

मूई सुरति बादु अहंकारु
{:.verse}

What dies is the individual - the divided ego.

ओहु न मूआ जो देखणहारु
{:.verse}

The witness of all, does not die.

---

जै कारणि तटि तीरथ जाही  
रतन पदारथ घट ही माही
{:.verse}

Why do you go on pilgrimage for, when the jewel is right here?

पड़ि पड़ि पंडितु बादु वखाणै  
भीतरि होदी वसतु न जाणै
{:.verse}

Reading again and again scholars debate and argue, while not knowing the thing within.

हउ न मूआ मेरी मुई बलाइ
{:.verse}

(After knowing this) I did not die, my misfortune died.

ओहु न मूआ जो रहिआ समाइ
{:.verse}

That which pervades all does not die.

---

कहु नानक गुरि ब्रहमु दिखाइआ
{:.verse}

Nanak says, the Guru shows that Brahman -

मरता जाता नदरि न आइआ
{:.verse}

\- (after seeing which) you don't see any death or departure.

---

> Body is elements. Mind is movement. Ego is mistaken identity. The witness is undying. Real pilgrimage is the inward turn.
> 
> ओहु न मूआ जो देखणहारु
> {:.verse}
> 
> The witness does not die. Know that to be the real Self. Not the temporary clump of matter and preferences.
> 
> Gu-ru literally means the dispeller of darkness; shining light on the Name of the all-pervasive Reality.
>
> Showing the Gold, not just the ornaments formed out of Gold. Showing the water, not just the waves that come and go on the water.

---

सुणि सुणि बूझै मानै नाउ
{:.verse}

Listening (to that Guru) again and again, I understand and accept the Name.

ता कै सद बलिहारै जाउ

To you, I forever surrender myself in devotion.

{:.verse}

Forgetting the Self, there was no refuge or stablity.

तूं समझावहि मेलि मिलाउ

You revealed and reconciled.

Once I got it, the Name walks alongside me.

Without it, everything seemed bound by Time.

The nectar of the (divine) Word, dyes you sweet.

---

हुकमि संजोगी गड़ि दस दुआर
{:.verse}

The (divine) Will constructs this ten-doored fort.

पंच वसहि मिलि जोति अपार
{:.verse}

Where the five (elements) dwell, united in the boundless Light.

आपि तुलै आपे वणजार
{:.verse}

The Self is measuring and trading with The Self.

नानक नामि सवारणहार
{:.verse}

*Nanak says, Naam is the one adorning it.*

---

> Hear, understand and stabilize. Once you get it, it stays. How to assess if you got it? If doubts are vanishing. If you see water rather than waves. If your body, mind and speech become calm, pure and sweet.
>
> आपि तुलै आपे वणजार
> {:.verse}
> 
> Ultimately, there is only one trading with itself. There is no independent individual. One reality, both experiencer and experienced.

> सहजे आवै सहजे जाइ
> {:.verse}
>
> It comes naturally, goes naturally.
>
> Sahaj implies abidance with what one already is. The Name is a pointer. Like hearing someone's name you instantly recognise who is being talked about.
