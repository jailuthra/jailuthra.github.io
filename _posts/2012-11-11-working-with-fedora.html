title: Working with Fedora
summary: I had been using Ubuntu for a while, but was looking for an alternative Linux distro ... I was in a dilemma between OpenSuse and Fedora KDE, and with a discussion at BVPLUG subreddit, decided to go with Fedora 17 KDE 64-bit. It is simply awesome. The package management is perfect, and clutter-free, It's fresh install

<div dir="ltr">I had been using Ubuntu for a while, but was looking for an alternative Linux distro satisfying these points - <br /><br />
<ul><a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank"><img style="border: 0px none; float: right; " alt="Fedora-Logo" src="https://fedoraproject.org/w/uploads/3/3c/Fedora_logo.png" width="199" height="91" border="0" /></a>
	<li>It is RPM based.</li>
	<li>It uses KDE as its default DE</li>
	<li>It is fast in updates.</li>
	<li>Big (Not in .iso size, of course) i.e. It is funded by some major firm, and is consistent in development.</li>
</ul><br />
<p>I was in a dilemma between OpenSuse and Fedora KDE, and with a discussion at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BVPLUG/comments/10y5om/opensuse_122_kde_or_fedora_17_kde/">BVPLUG subreddit</a>, decided to go with Fedora 17 KDE 64-bit.</p>

<p>It is simply awesome. The package management is perfect, and clutter-free, It's fresh install feels lightweight compared to Ubuntu Quantal's fresh install which was laggy (maybe due to webapps, and amazuntu). And I'm in love with its superfast updates.
Fedora is a cutting edge distro, thus releasing updates asap. A new version of KDE or kernel updates, everything is just updated as soon as the stable release is out, which I missed in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I also installed XFCE, and it is blazing fast compared to KDE or Unity. It is quite configurable(not more than KDE though), and I just love its simplicity. Pair Fedora with - XFCE, cairo-dock, Faenza icons, and a nice GTK theme and wallpaper, and experience terrificness!</p>

<p>But still Ubuntu beats Fedora in ease of installation, and a good "Software Center".
In short, if you don't have loads of packages to deal with, and you don't like firing up a terminal now and then, Ubuntu is much better.
I would still recommend Ubuntu to anyone who wanted to switch to Linux. It is the most popular, and its support is superb.</p></div>
